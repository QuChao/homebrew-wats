# Homebrew formulae
## Formulae:

- `dnsmasq-fast-lookup.rb`: [A fork](https://github.com/infinet/dnsmasq) of the original lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server, featuring fast ipset/server/address lookups.
- `haproxy-libressl.rb`: Reliable, high performance TCP/HTTP load balancer w/ LibreSSL.
- `nali.rb`: [A tool](https://github.com/soffchen/qqwry/tree/master/nali) to display geolocation info of an IP (in Chinese) which could be used in pipelines as well. The geolocation data is from [ipip.net](http://www.ipip.net/) and converted into qqwry.dat format with [this tool](https://www.shuax.com/archives/ipip_to_qqwry.html).
